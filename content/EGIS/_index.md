### What is EGIS ?
EGIS is an acronym for sustainable software, which means software that is:
* **Ethical** : using fair solutions for a better world
* **Green** : with minimal impact on the climate
* **Inclusive** : implementing diversity by design
* **Simple** : easy to create and maintain

### Ethical IT
Big Tech is a major factor of injustice, it undermines democracy and increases the social gap between the wealthiest and the poorest. But Big Tech is not the only Tech and there are multiple ways to reduce the power of the technology giants.

### Green IT
IT produces more greenhouse gases than the aviation industry, and it is growing, notably because of AI. But it is possible to act to reduce the impacts of ITs on our environment and thus apply a form of digital sobriety through eco-responsible behaviors and choices

### Inclusive IT
Inclusion is about taking care of all forms of diversity (racial, gender), but also to take care of disability, as the disability community deserves equal access to websites and online services.
