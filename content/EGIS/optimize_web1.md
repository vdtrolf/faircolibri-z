To reduce the carbon footprint of a website, it's crucial to take into account several factors related to design, development and hosting. Here are a few strategies and technologies that can help create a more CO2-efficient web stack:

**Code and resource optimization** :
* Use energy-efficient programming languages, such as C or Rust, for intensive tasks.
* Minimize the use of heavy libraries and frameworks. For example, choose lightweight frameworks such as Flask for Python or Express.js for Node.js.

**Frontend efficiency** :
* Reduce the size of CSS and JavaScript files by using minification and compression tools.
* Optimize images and use modern formats such as WebP, which offer good quality at lower weight.
* Implement “lazy loading” for images and videos to load only the resources required for initial page display.

**Hosting**:
* Opt for hosting companies that use renewable energies. Companies like GreenGeeks, DreamHost and A2 Hosting are known for their green initiatives.
* Use data centers that are ecologically cooled and optimize energy use.

**Reduce network requests** :
* Use CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) to reduce latency and load on servers.
* Cache static resources to minimize the number of HTTP requests.

**User-centered design** :
* Improve information architecture to reduce browsing time and energy consumption.
* Include clear calls to action to help users achieve their goals more quickly.

**Continuous monitoring and optimization** :
* Use tools to monitor website performance and carbon footprint.
* Carry out regular audits to identify and correct bottlenecks in performance and energy efficiency.

By implementing these practices, it is possible to significantly reduce a website's carbon footprint while improving its performance and user experience.
