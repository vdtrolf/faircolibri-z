### Our Home

We all are in the midst of a climate and ecological breakdown. We are facing an uncertain future – our world is in crisis and life itself is under threat. 

_“Maybe we need to re-engage our smart, energetic youth around the world to be farmers and find fresh, green technologies that will feed the world more fresh greens”_
